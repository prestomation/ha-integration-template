"""Custom sidebar panel registration for the Example Integration.

Serves the built TypeScript bundle as a static path and registers a full-page
custom panel in the HA sidebar via the built-in ``custom`` panel component with
a ``_panel_custom`` config block — exactly the mechanism HA's own
``panel_custom`` integration uses — so the sidebar entry appears with no user
YAML required.
