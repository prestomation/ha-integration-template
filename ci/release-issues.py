"""Extract a CHANGELOG section and the GitHub issues it says it fixes.

``release.yml`` uses this twice. Once to pull the ``## [X.Y.Z]`` section out of
``CHANGELOG.md`` for the GitHub Release body, and once to work out which issues that
release ships a fix for, so ``notify-issues`` can tell each reporter which version
carries it (and close the issue when that version is stable).

That second use is why the parsing is strict. An issue only closes because its number
appeared here, so a false positive closes something that isn't fixed:

* Only ``Fixes|Closes|Resolves #N`` counts. The CHANGELOG also carries softer refs
  like ``(Related to #161)``, which must *not* close anything.
* A bare ``(#N)`` never counts. This repo overloads it — ``(#189)`` in a commit
  subject is the PR number appended by squash-merge, while ``(#183)`` in the same
  subject is the issue. There is no way to tell them apart, so neither is read.

Usage:
    python3 ci/release-issues.py --version 0.16.0 --notes   # the section, verbatim
    python3 ci/release-issues.py --version 0.16.0 --json    # [{"number":…,"summary":…}]
    git log --format=%B a..b | python3 ci/release-issues.py --scan  # refs, one per line

``--notes`` and ``--json`` exit 1 when the version has no section — a release must
not ship with empty notes, and ``release.yml`` already treated that as fatal.
