tests import it as ``from asserts import raises_exactly``. ``pythonpath`` in

    The validation messages are contract, not decoration: the service layer
    re-raises them to the user as ``ServiceValidationError`` and the panel shows
    them verbatim, so a test that asserts only "something was raised" lets the
    wrong message (or an empty one) ship unnoticed.

    Anchored and escaped on purpose. ``pytest.raises(match=...)`` is a *search*
    over a regex, so an unanchored pattern passes on a message with anything
    added at either end, and a message containing ``(`` or ``.`` would otherwise
    be read as a pattern rather than as text.
