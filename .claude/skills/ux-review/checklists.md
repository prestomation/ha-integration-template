# Review item lists

In **Stage 1** (raw pass) answer every applicable item, also the ones that pass, with
`✓ / ✗ / n/a`, a one-line observation and a screenshot ref. In **Stage 2** each `✗` is a
candidate finding, kept only when it affects the persona's goal (see `SKILL.md`). Apply the
**shared spine** to every screen, plus the list for the brief's `surface_type`. Apply the
**aesthetics & craft** list once, app-level, from the style-inventory measurements. Each
group cites its UX sources.

## Shared spine — every screen

**Visual hierarchy & grouping** *(NN/g visual design, Gestalt)*
- Does the eye land on the goal-relevant action/info first, matching its importance?
- Are related elements grouped (proximity, shared style, a container) and unrelated ones separated?

**Emphasis & placement of actions** *(Material emphasis tiers; Apple HIG; Von Restorff; Fitts &
Hick; WCAG 2.2 §2.5.8)*
- Is exactly one element the clear visual primary on this screen, and is it the goal action — with
  competing actions visibly subordinate in weight/contrast/size (no prominence inversion, where a
  lesser or destructive action outweighs the main one)?
- Are actions where the persona expects them and ordered by convention — primary consistently
  placed, destructive separated from primary, dialog/form button order following the platform —
  rather than hunted for?
- Does each action sit next to the object or context it affects (proximity), and is it reachable
  and large enough on the target device (target size, thumb zone on mobile)?

**Consistent meaning of color & icons** *(semantic color; WCAG "not color alone")*
- Does every color encode one consistent, learnable meaning (e.g. red = error/destructive, never
  decorative)?
- Is anything signalled by color also carried by text/icon/shape (survives grayscale &
  colorblindness)?
- Do icons carry stable meanings, labelled where ambiguous?

**Feedback & system status** *(Nielsen #1, #9)*
- After every meaningful action, is there timely feedback on what happened and the new state?
- On error, is the message plain-language, attached to the right place, with a clear recovery path?

**Error prevention & recall** *(Nielsen #5, #6)*
- Are likely errors prevented up front (constraints, sensible defaults, confirm
  destructive/irreversible actions)?
- Are the options/info the user needs visible in context, not something they must remember from a
  prior screen?

**Consistency & language** *(Nielsen #2, #4; legibility)*
- Do the same words, controls, and patterns mean the same thing everywhere, following conventions?
- Are labels/messages in the user's language (no system jargon) and do they say what will actually
  happen?
- Is text legible — size, contrast, reading order?

## Aesthetics & craft — app-level, once

*Run after the style-inventory tool has measured the key screens. **Evidence rule:** each
`✗` here must cite a measurement from that report (confirmed in the screenshot) or a tone
constraint in the brief, never eyeballed geometry or taste. Severity caps at **medium**
unless the issue breaks legibility or comprehension (then it is a usability finding).*

**Craft — measured** *(type-scale practice; 4/8-pt spacing systems; WCAG 1.4.3)*
1. Is the type scale coherent — roughly 4–7 distinct sizes, no near-duplicate
   sizes (13px next to 14px), no visible text under 12px?
2. Is the palette disciplined — no near-duplicate colors doing the same job, and
   no decorative colors diluting the meaningful ones from the encoding inventory?
3. Are corner radii and shadows consistent across equivalent surfaces (cards,
   panels, inputs), rather than mixed for no reason?
4. Does spacing come from a consistent scale (e.g. multiples of 4), with
   equivalent gaps actually equal?
5. Do elements that are meant to line up actually line up — no confirmed
   near-miss edges (2–10px off a shared gridline or off their siblings)?
6. Does all text meet WCAG contrast (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large), per computed
   ratios — not judged by eye?
7. Is nothing unintentionally truncated, clipped, or overlapping at the brief's
   primary viewport?

**Register — judged against the brief** *(brand/tone review practice)*
8. Does the rendered UI read as the brief's tone words? Name the concrete
   signals — shape language (radii, pill vs square), color saturation,
   typography, copy voice, emoji/illustration — that support or contradict each
   stated adjective (e.g. rounded bubbly buttons + emoji + saturated pastels
   read "playful" against a brief that says "professional, trustworthy").
9. Does the copy's voice match the persona and tone — exclamation marks, slang,
   or cuteness where the brief asks for calm, or stiff jargon where it asks for
   friendly?
10. Does visual density match the context of use — a calm, breathing layout for
    a consumer/first-time surface; an information-dense one for a professional
    tool the persona lives in?

## guided-flow — onboarding, forms, checkout, wizards, setup

*Apply per step. Items 1–4 are the backbone (cognitive walkthrough); run them on every step first.*

**Next-action clarity** *(cognitive walkthrough)*
1. Will the user form the right goal for this step (clear what it's for and why)?
2. Is the single correct next action visible and noticeable, not hunted for?
3. Will they connect that control to the outcome they want (labels name the outcome, e.g.
   "Continue to payment")?
4. After acting, is it clear they made progress toward the goal?

**Input & effort** *(GOV.UK one-thing-per-page; NN/g cognitive load; Baymard)*
5. Is the step scoped to one thing, not overloaded with unrelated asks?
6. Is every field actually necessary here, or can it be deferred/dropped?
7. Right input control & keyboard for the data type; required vs. optional unambiguous; labels
   persistent (not vanishing placeholders)?

**Errors** *(Baymard inline validation)*
8. Is input validated at the right moment (on blur, with positive confirmation), and are messages
   specific, adjacent, and fix-oriented?

**Progress & control** *(NN/g wizards; flexibility heuristic)*
9. Does the user know where they are and how much remains?
10. Can they go back and change earlier answers without losing data?
11. Is there a review/confirm before an irreversible commit?

**Trust** *(Baymard checkout)*
12. At sensitive input or commitment, is it clear why the data is needed, what happens next, and
    that it's safe (cost transparency, no surprise steps)?

## browse-search — search, listing, faceted filtering, content discovery

**Finding (search & filter)** *(Baymard search & filters; NN/g faceted search)*
1. Is search available, sensibly scoped, and tolerant of typos/synonyms/partial terms?
2. Are filters/facets relevant, predictable, jargon-free, prioritized — applied filters visible &
   individually removable, with a live result count?

**Scanning & information scent** *(NN/g information scent, list entries, cards)*
3. Does each result give a strong "scent" of where it leads (label, snippet, context) before
   clicking?
4. Can the user tell results apart at a glance without opening each one?
5. Is the key decision info (title, price, status, date) in a consistent position so the eye scans
   one column?
6. Is list-vs-grid / image-vs-text suited to the content and to comparison?

**Evaluating & comparing** *(NN/g product photos, comparison; Baymard sort)*
7. Are at-a-glance quality cues present without forcing a drill-down, and can results be sorted by
   what matters with a clear default?

**Result quality & empty states** *(Baymard no-results; search scope)*
8. Is a zero-results state a recovery point (related queries, broader category, relaxed filters),
   not a dead end?
9. Is result scope/progress clear (total count, range, load-more without losing place)?

**Navigation & orientation** *(NN/g large information spaces; GOV.UK navigation)*
10. Can the user always tell where they are and get back or broaden (location, breadcrumbs, path
    to a wider set)?

## monitoring — dashboards, admin consoles, status pages, analytics

**At-a-glance comprehension** *(Stephen Few; NN/g dashboards)*
1. Can the user grasp overall status and the few most important numbers within seconds, without
   scrolling or interaction?
2. Does the primary view fit one screen, so attention isn't fragmented across paging?
3. Do charts use fast encodings (length, position — bars/lines) over angle/area (pie/gauge) and no
   3D?

**Hierarchy & density** *(Stephen Few; NN/g complex apps)*
4. Are the most decision-critical metrics the most salient, with secondary data visibly subordinate?
5. Has non-data ink (decoration, heavy gridlines, redundancy) been stripped?
6. Are numbers shown with context (vs. target/prior/threshold) and sensible precision?

**Status & alerting** *(Stephen Few; semantic color + accessibility)*
7. Are abnormal/alert states visually distinct and immediately findable, not buried among normal
   values?
8. Is alert meaning carried by more than color alone (icon, label, shape, position)?

**Drill-down & actionability** *(NN/g data tables, complex apps)*
9. From a flagged metric, is there a clear path to the detail or the action it implies?
10. For tables, does the layout support find/compare/act, with header rows/columns frozen when it
    overflows?

**Legibility** *(NN/g charts; Stephen Few)*
11. Are axes, units, time range, and "data as of" freshness labelled so a number can't be misread?
12. Is the chart type matched to the question (trend → line, comparison → bar, part-to-whole
    sparingly)?

**Chart perception — read the rendered chart** *(Stephen Few; Cleveland & McGill)*
13. **Honest baseline & scale:** does each bar/line value axis start at zero (or mark a
    deliberate break), so heights and slopes do not exaggerate or flatten the real change?
14. **Series distinguishable in the pixels:** can you tell each overlaid series apart (actual
    vs target, several lines) by colour, dash, marker or direct label, as the legend claims?
15. **No prominence inversion:** is the single largest / first-read element the most
    decision-critical metric — not a cost or vanity figure blown up larger (hero slot, biggest
    type, highlighted card) than the outcome it should serve?
