title: UX review precedents
summary: Genre conventions per surface type that a ux-review uses in Stage 2 to frame findings as expectation breaks.
---

# Precedent library — genre conventions

What users have been trained to expect by every other app in the genre. A senior
reviewer's edge is mostly this: knowing where users will look, what they'll call
things, and what the rest of the web has taught them — so a violation reads as
"users trained by other checkout flows will look for X here and not find it",
not as a taste preference.

**How to use (Stage 2).** Look up the brief's `surface_type` below. For each
finding candidate, ask whether a convention explains *why* it hurts — an
expectation break is stronger, more legible reasoning than a bare heuristic.
Also scan the list for conventions the app violates that the checklist didn't
surface. Discipline:

- A violated convention is a **candidate**, not automatically a finding — it
  still must slow or block *this persona's* goal, and `scope.out` still applies
  (a deliberate divergence stated in the brief is not a finding).
- Conventions describe the genre's dominant pattern, not a law. An app may break
  one deliberately *and well*; flag it only when the break costs orientation,
  trust, or task success.
- Cite the convention in the finding's `why it matters` ("every mainstream
  dashboard puts the range picker top-right; the persona will look there
  first").

Each table row gives a **convention**, where users learned it, and what a violation looks
like.

## guided-flow — checkout, signup, wizards, booking

### Layout & placement

| Convention | Where users learned it | What a violation looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **Keep the order/booking summary persistently visible (right rail on desktop).** | Universal e-commerce pattern (Amazon, Shopify checkout, airline/hotel booking). | The summary lives only at the top of a scrolling page and disappears by the time the user enters payment details. |
| **Primary continue action bottom-right on desktop, full-width bottom on mobile.** | Near-universal checkout/wizard convention; matches reading direction and thumb reach. | The primary CTA is centered, left-aligned, or floats mid-page, so users hunt for it after each section. |
| **Collapse promo/coupon entry behind a "Have a promo code?" link, not an open field.** | Baymard checkout research. | An always-open coupon box next to the total makes every user without a code feel they're overpaying and leave to hunt for one. |
| **Show the full cost breakdown (subtotal, shipping, tax, total) before the final step.** | Baymard: surprise costs at checkout are the #1 cited abandonment reason. | Shipping/tax first appears after card details are entered. |
| **Offer guest checkout as prominently as sign-in; never force account creation.** | Baymard: forced registration is a top abandonment cause. | The only path past the cart is a "Sign in or Register" wall. |
| **Anchor field errors inline at the field, with a top-of-page error summary linking down to each.** | GOV.UK Design System error-summary pattern. | A lone toast says "There was a problem" with no pointer to which of 12 fields is wrong. |

### Buttons & labels

| Convention | Where users learned it | What a violation looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **Label the primary button with the outcome of the next step, not a generic verb.** | Form-design research (Wroblewski) and mainstream checkout copy: "Continue to payment", "Book now" — not "Submit"/"Next"/"OK". | Every step says "Submit", so users can't tell which click commits. |
| **Reserve "Place order" / "Pay now" / "Confirm booking" for the single money-moving step — and never label that step "Next".** | Users rely on the label to know when they'll be charged. | "Next" actually charges the card, or an early step says "Place order" and users think they've already paid. |
| **Back/secondary actions visually subordinate to the primary (link or outline, never equal weight).** | Material / Apple HIG button hierarchy, carried into every mature checkout. | "Back" and "Continue" are twin solid buttons and users click the wrong one. |

### Progress & navigation

| Convention | Where users learned it | What a violation looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **Show a labeled step indicator across the top of a multi-step flow.** | NN/g wizard pattern; "Cart → Shipping → Payment → Review". | Unlabeled dots or nothing, so users can't estimate remaining effort. |
| **Going back — or editing an earlier step — never erases data entered elsewhere.** | Core wizard expectation (NN/g); mature checkouts return you to your place with everything intact. | Editing the shipping address wipes the filled payment fields. |
| **Completed steps in the indicator are clickable to jump back and edit.** | Standard in GOV.UK-style and e-commerce wizards. | The progress bar is decorative and the only way back is one screen at a time. |
| **One primary question/decision per screen in long or branching flows.** | GOV.UK "one thing per page". | Address, shipping method, and gift options on one mega-page whose validation errors bury each other. |
| **Partially entered data survives a closed tab or a resumed session.** | Cart/draft persistence is the norm in booking and commerce. | Reopening the site drops the selected dates and returns to search. |

### Trust & payment

| Convention | Where users learned it | What a violation looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **Trust signals (lock icon, card-brand logos, "secure checkout") sit next to the payment fields, not just the footer.** | Baymard trust-seal research. | Nothing near the card-number field says the form is safe. |
| **Card inputs auto-format as you type (spacing, brand icon); never reject a pasted number over spaces.** | Stripe-era convention across modern payment forms. | "4111 1111 1111 1111" errors with no live formatting or hint. |
| **"Billing same as shipping" is a pre-checked shortcut, not two full duplicate forms.** | Universal checkout pattern; its absence is one of Baymard's most-cited friction points. | Two full duplicate address forms. |

**Watch first — most likely to cause outright task failure:** forced account
creation with no guest path; back/edit destroying entered data; costs surfacing
only at the final screen.

## browse-search — listings, search results, faceted filtering, docs search

### Search box

| Convention | Where users learned it | What a violation looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **Search sits top-center/top-right of the header, magnifier icon, submits on Enter.** | Universal pattern since the 2000s. | Search buried in a hamburger menu, or Enter does nothing. |
| **Autocomplete/instant suggestions appear as the user types, with the match highlighted.** | Algolia-era standard on retailers and docs sites. | A full query + Enter lands on an empty "type to search" page. |
| **The typed query persists in the box after results load (and in the URL).** | Universal. | The box resets to placeholder, so users can't see or refine what they searched. |
| **On docs/developer sites, Cmd/Ctrl+K (or `/`) opens search.** | Normalized by Algolia DocSearch across thousands of docs sites. | A docs site where the reflexive Cmd+K does nothing. |

### Filters & facets

| Convention | Where users learned it | What a violation looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **Filters live in a left rail on desktop; on mobile, behind a "Filters" button opening a sheet/tray over the results.** | Baymard product-list research and NN/g faceted search; Amazon/eBay-era muscle memory. | Filters below the results or on a separate page that loses the list. |
| **Applied filters show as removable chips above the results, each with its own ×, plus a "Clear all".** | Baymard: sites that hide applied filters strand users debugging their own result set. | The only record of active filters is re-opening the panel to find checked boxes. |
| **Facet values carry live result counts ("Blue (128)"), and long lists truncate behind "Show more".** | Baymard/NN/g faceted search. | Users select a filter blind and land on zero results, or scroll 80 brand checkboxes. |
| **Desktop filters apply immediately on toggle; an explicit "Show results" button belongs only on the mobile sheet.** | The converged pattern per Baymard/NN/g. | Desktop checkboxes that silently wait for an Apply click, so users think the click did nothing. |

### Results & scanning

| Convention | Where users learned it | What a violation looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **Result cards carry the decision info inline — image, title, price, rating + review count — before any click.** | Universal e-commerce pattern. | Comparison-shopping requires opening each item to see its rating or price. |
| **A result count sits at the top of the list ("1,248 results") and updates live with filters.** | Baymard/NN/g. | No count, so users can't tell whether three filters left 4 items or 400. |
| **Sort control top-right of the results, labeled "Sort by", defaulting to relevance/featured, with the standard option set.** | Universal; users' mental model of the options comes from Amazon/eBay. | A "Price: Low to High" default buries the best matches under clearance junk. |
| **Pagination style matches the task: infinite scroll / "Load more" for casual browsing; numbered pages for precise, returnable sets (docs, parts catalogs).** | Baymard distinguishes these by task type. | Infinite scroll on a reference list makes "result #40" impossible to return to. |

### Orientation & recovery

| Convention | Where users learned it | What a violation looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **Breadcrumbs sit above the title with every ancestor clickable; the header logo always links home.** | Universal web conventions. | Dead breadcrumb text (or none) on a deep category page strands users who arrived from a search engine. |
| **Query, filters, and sort are reflected in the URL — shareable, bookmarkable, back-button-safe.** | Universal. | Browser back after opening a product returns to an unfiltered page one. |
| **Zero results offer real recovery: "did you mean…" spelling fix plus a broader-category link — never a bare dead end.** | Baymard zero-results research (generic "try different keywords" text gets ignored). | "No results for 'snikers'" with no way forward. |
| **On docs search, results group by type/section ("Guides", "API Reference"), not one flat list.** | DocSearch-era standard. | Changelog entries, reference pages, and blog posts interleaved with no visual distinction. |

**Watch first — most likely to cause outright task failure:** applied filters
invisible/not removable; zero-results dead ends; a non-relevance sort default.

## monitoring — dashboards, admin consoles, status pages, analytics

### Page anatomy

| Convention | Where users learned it | What a violation looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **KPI/summary cards run across the top, ordered left-to-right by importance — the decision-critical metric leftmost.** | Few, *Information Dashboard Design*; NN/g eye-tracking (attention lands top-left first). | The north-star metric mid-row or last (or a cost metric in the hero slot) so a skimming reader never weights it correctly. |
| **Top band = status/KPIs, middle = trends, bottom = detail tables.** | Few's at-a-glance layering, reused by Datadog/Grafana. | A raw data table above the summary, forcing a scroll past detail to find the headline. |
| **Global scope selectors (org, project, environment) live in a persistent header, above and separate from page-level filters; the left nav navigates, it never scopes data.** | Grafana/Datadog/AWS-console convention; NN/g complex-application guidance. | A nav click that silently changes the applied account or date range. |

### Time & scope controls

| Convention | Where users learned it | What a violation looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **The date/time-range picker sits top-right, above the fold, and applies globally to everything below it.** | Universal (Google Analytics, Looker, Grafana, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Datadog). | A per-chart-only picker, or a global control that silently scopes only some charts with no cue which. |
| **Range presets (Today, 7d, 30d, MTD, Custom) come before a raw calendar, and the active range stays visible as a label.** | GA/Mixpanel/Looker convention. | Counting back 30 days on a calendar by hand, or no way to see which range is active. |
| **"Vs. previous period" comparison is a toggle next to the range picker, not a separate report.** | GA/Amplitude/Mixpanel. | Mentally diffing two exports to see growth. |
| **A "last updated" freshness stamp sits near the top (typically by the range picker), never buried in a footer.** | Universal ops/BI convention. | No stamp on a live-looking view, so a flat line could mean "quiet" or "data stopped flowing". |
| **Auto-refresh is a visible, user-controllable toggle near the time picker.** | Grafana/Datadog. | A silent refresh yanks a zoomed chart back to default with no indication why. |

### KPI cards & deltas

| Convention | Where users learned it | What a violation looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **Every KPI carries a delta vs. the prior comparable period beside it, with an up/down arrow.** | Universal SaaS dashboard pattern (Stripe, GA, Mixpanel). | A bare number — is 4,213 signups good or a 40% drop? |
| **Delta color follows the metric's goodness direction, not the arrow's direction.** | Few's color semantics; Stripe/Datadog practice ("error rate ↓" is green; "revenue ↓" is red). | A falling churn number colored red, reading as bad news when it's the win. |
| **KPI cards click through to the underlying detail, often with a sparkline inline.** | GA/Mixpanel/Looker/Stripe-era convention. | A dead-end number whose breakdown must be hunted through a separate menu. |

### Charts & legends

| Convention | Where users learned it | What a violation looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **Legends sit immediately adjacent to their chart (right or directly beneath), never shared across the page.** | Few's proximity principle; standard in Looker/Grafana/Tableau. | One bottom-of-page legend for six charts above it. |
| **The same entity keeps the same series color in every chart on the page.** | Few + Grafana/Datadog convention. | "US" is blue in one chart and orange in the next, breaking the legend-by-memory users build while scanning. |
| **Charts drill down: clicking a point/bar narrows into that slice's detail.** | GA/Mixpanel/Amplitude/Looker. | Charts that are inert images. |
| **Time-series panels sharing an axis share a synchronized hover crosshair.** | Grafana/Datadog multi-panel convention. | Correlating 2pm across two adjacent graphs by eye. |

### Status & alerting

| Convention | Where users learned it | What a violation looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **Red/amber/green severity keeps red = worst, everywhere, ordered by severity in the scan direction.** | Statuspage-era convention across Datadog/PagerDuty/AWS Health. | A swapped or inconsistent mapping that misleads an operator mid-incident. |
| **The aggregate status banner sits at the very top of a status page, above per-component rows.** | Statuspage convention. | Reading every component row to infer overall health. |
| **Active incidents/alerts pin above resolved history, with a count badge near the title/nav.** | Datadog/PagerDuty/Grafana. | A live outage sorted under resolved items by ID. |
| **Severity carries an icon/shape per level, never color alone.** | WCAG-driven convention adopted by Datadog/Grafana. | Color-only status dots, indistinguishable in grayscale or to colorblind users. |

**Watch first — most likely to cause misreading (not just friction):** delta
color ignoring the metric's goodness direction; a missing/stale freshness stamp;
inconsistent severity color mapping.
