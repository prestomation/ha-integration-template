# Source of this skill

This directory is a copy of `skills/ux-review/` from
https://github.com/crowecawcaw/ux-skills at commit
`b772a0945bbe1918ccf919ea95a50ce5216f5f53`. `SKILL.md` is shortened to the repository line
cap, and the `report.md` format is in `examples.md`. The process is the same. To update the
skill, compare it with a newer upstream commit, apply the changes, and change the commit in
this file.

## How to use the skill in this repository

- **The running app.** Start Home Assistant with the seeded data:
  `KEEP_UP=1 bash ci/e2e-up.sh`. The panel is at
  `http://localhost:8123/example-integration`. Log in as the e2e user from
  `tests/e2e/global-setup.ts`, or use the saved session state that the global setup
  writes.
- **The screenshots.** Use the Playwright harness in `tests/e2e/` in place of the
  upstream `shoot.mjs` helper. Write review screenshots to the output directory of
  the review, not to `docs/images/`.
- **The style inventory.** Use `tools/style-inventory-ha.mjs`, not the upstream
  `tools/style-inventory.mjs`. The upstream tool does not look inside shadow roots,
  so on Home Assistant it measures only the loading screen. The copy collects the
  elements in every open shadow root and logs in with the session state that
  `tests/e2e/global-setup.ts` writes. Run it from `tests/e2e`, so that
  `playwright-core` resolves:

  ```bash
  STORAGE_STATE=.auth/state.json \
    node ../../.claude/skills/ux-review/tools/style-inventory-ha.mjs <scenario.json> <out.md>
  ```

  Give the scenario a first `wait` of about 9000 ms. A cold panel is still on the
  loading screen after 4 s. The report covers the whole page, with the Home Assistant
  sidebar, so judge only the elements of the surface that you review.
- **The brief.** Write the brief for the surface that you review. The persona is a
  Home Assistant user who manages the items. The surface type is usually `dashboard`
  or `list`. The tone words come from the Home Assistant frontend: calm, dense,
  functional.
- **Phone and desktop.** Review both widths (`DESKTOP` and `PHONE` in
  `tests/e2e/viewports.ts`).
